      <description>&lt;h1&gt;Capstone - Recursive Delegation 2016&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my time at SAIT I spent a year working on a Capstone project. This capstone project was done with a group of 4 in which we were called Recursive Delegation. This Capstone serves as a milestone to show our growth at our time at SAIT. Our client was a researcher for the Applied Research and Innovation division at SAIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
Our clients issue was that he was spending too much time gathering data from different sources and spending too much time on report generation. An estimated 8-16 hours a week was spent gathering data and generating reports when the clients time could be spent much more effeciently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Our Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
Our Solution was to create a web-based application that automatically collects and centralizes all the clients data in a centralized location for visualization aswell as automatic report generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Application&lt;/h2&gt;
